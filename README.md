# loan-detection-analysis
A data visualization project analyzing loan approval trends using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`.
**PROJECT OVERVIEW**
In this project, I explored a loan application dataset to figure out what factors influence whether a loan gets approved or not. I used Python, along with Matplotlib and Seaborn, to create visualizations and uncover patterns in the data
**SKILLS USED**
-EXCEL, MATPLOTLIB, NUMPY, SEABORN

**KEY DATASET**

Gender , Annual_Income, Education, Property_Area, Credit_Score, Loan_Approval etc.

Here I have presented 6 different visuals to show the loan data analysis 
You can see the visuals folder 

**Conclusion**

- Based on the loan  detection dataset analysis, I  observe that female , married individuals, and 
   those who are not graduate got more loans than the other one
- Rural and semiurban got almost same loan distribution
- the differences in the data are minor
